Header Section
The header includes the "mojo" logo and two navigation bars. The first navigation (navbar-1) features links like "Articles," "Shop," "Magazine," and "Help." The second (navbar-2) provides user-specific links for "Joe Doe" and a "Cart" with an item count. The use of classes like d-flex, align-item-center, and justify-space-between indicates a flexible box (flexbox) layout for arranging elements. Multiple container classes (container-xl, container-lg, etc.) suggest a grid-based system for responsiveness.

Main Content Area
The main section houses the core content, divided into a hero section and a shoes section.

Hero Section
The hero section is a prominent display area. It features a navigational bar (hero-nav) with categories like "POPULAR," "MOST VIEWED," "NEWEST," and "RANDOM." Below this, the hero-content is structured with a row containing two columns (col-6). One column (hero-img) displays a large image, while the other (hero-header) presents a headline ("Hiroshi Fijiwara's X Nike"), a descriptive paragraph, and a "Watch The Video" call to action. The order-1 and order-2 classes likely control the visual order of these columns on different screen sizes.

Shoes Section
The shoes section showcases multiple product items. It starts with a central header (shoes-header) including a title ("Other Great Shoes") and a brief description. Below this, another row holds three columns (col-4), each representing a product item. Each shoes-item displays an image of a shoe, its name ("Nike Roshe Gold"), stock information, and price. This section is also designed to be responsive using the container classes.
